MedExpress – Consultation API

This project is a basic Consultation MVP for the MedExpress service in Genovia.
It allows customers to answer a predefined set of health-related questions and determines whether they are likely
eligible to receive medication.

Tech Stack

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- Spring Web
- Lombok
- Jakarta Bean Validation
- Postman for testing

Instructions

This project can be run using gradle:
- Linux/macOS: ./gradlew bootRun
- Windows: gradlew bootRun

The application will be started on http://localhost:8080, move to http://localhost:8080/consultation/questions
to see the list of questions.

Postman collection was added to the postman directory allowing access to all endpoints.

Endpoints

- GET /questions — retrieve a list of medical questions for the consultation process
- POST /answers/{customerId} — submit answers to consultation questions
- GET /answers — return all answers in the system
- GET /answers/{customerId} — return all answers submitted by a specific customer
- GET /eligibility/{customerId} — returns whether a customer is likely eligible for medication

Limitations

- Not persistent storage (was not required) - data will be lost when app restarts
- Not thread-safe - using HashMap to store the questions and the answers
    - could lead to race conditions if two or more users access the resource at the same time
- Basic eligibility logic - if answer is yes then user is not eligible
    - currently it is a template, can be improved if clearer requirements are provided
- Question id is not validated when saving answers
    - it is assumed by the developer that customers are answering to existent questions
- Validation errors are not returned in the response because GlobalExceptionHandler was not added
- No unit tests or integration tests were created
